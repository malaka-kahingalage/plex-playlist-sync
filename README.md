# plex-playlist-sync
A Python tool to sync Spotify playlists and artists with your Plex music library. It fetches tracks from Spotify, matches them to Plex using fuzzy logic, downloads missing songs from sources like YouTube, SoundCloud, or Bandcamp, updates Plex playlists, and generates reports for unmatched tracks.
